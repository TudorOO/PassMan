PassMan is a privacy-first, open-source password manager built with Flask, SQLite, and strong cryptography. It offers both client-side and server-side encryption, TOTP-based 2FA, breach detection via HaveIBeenPwned, and a responsive Bootstrap interface.

**No tracking, no data mining — just secure, local-first password storage.**
