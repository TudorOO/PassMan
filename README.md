# 🔐 PassMan — Your Secure, Self-Hosted Password Vault

PassMan is a privacy-first, open-source password manager built with Flask, SQLite, and strong cryptography. It offers both client-side and server-side encryption, TOTP-based 2FA, breach detection via HaveIBeenPwned, and a responsive Bootstrap interface.

No tracking, no data mining, just secure, local-first password storage.

ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```
3. Build the Docker image
