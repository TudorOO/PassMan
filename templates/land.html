    <br>
    <p class = "text-center">Passman password manager provides a safe way to create and store incredibly strong passwords for all of your apps.
        It provides safety and convenience, removing the need to remember an ever-growing number of passwords, while also making sure that 
        they are complex enough to be safe in the event of a breach.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h4>Why it's safe:</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>1. The master password is never stored on the server, not even temporarily.</h5>
    <p>This makes sure that, even if our server is breached, your passwords will still be safe.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>2. The passwords are stored using the latest encryption technology available.</h5>
    <p>We hash the master password with <b>Argon2id</b> and encrypt the passwords using a key derived from the master password with <b>AESGCM</b>. 
    These technologies provide powerful protection against even the strongest attacks, such as GPU-Based ones.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>3. Encryption and decryption of passwords can happen either only server-side, or both client-side and server-side.</h5>
    <p>You get to choose! Do you trust your machine more or our server more? Whichever the case, you can have it your way: minimal-knowledge or zero-knowledge!</p>
    <br>
    <h5>4. No AI corners cut.</h5>
    <p>All code in this project is written and audited by hand, without AI-generated components, to ensure full transparency and control over security logic.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>5. No-password login.</h5>
    <p>If you forget your master password, no worries! You can download a backup file which you can then use to login without the password.</p>
    <p>WARNING: While the backup file is encrypted, we do not provide any protection in the case that a nefarious actor gets a hold of it. You should store it incredibly safely, ideally in an USB or another location not connected to the internet.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h4>How it works:</h4><br>

    <h5>1. You make an account</h5>
    <p>The master password you provide is encrypted using <b>scrypt</b> and stored. In addition, a backup file is generated, which you can then download and use if you wish to login without a password later.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>2. You create a passkey for an app</h5>
    <p>The passkey you create is encrypted with <b>AES-GCM</b> with a key derived from the master password using <b>Argon2id</b> which is not ever stored on the disk. This passkey can then be revealed at any time 
    by inputting the master password again. All encryption is done with random nonces and all derivation is done with user-specific salts.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Other features(some not yet added):</h4>
    <h5>1. Resetting passwords</h5>
    <h5>2. Two Factor Authentication</h5>
    <h5>3. Zero-knowledge mode(client+server side AES-GCM encryption/decryption)</h5>
    <h5>4. Breach monitoring</h5>
    <h5>5. YubiKey integration</h5>
    <br><br>
